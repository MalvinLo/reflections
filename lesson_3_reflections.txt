refleciton response:
collaborating with multiple people
switching computers
when backup is warranted
command(s):
git remote
git remote add remoteName aURL
git remote -v (verbose, for more detailed list of remotes)
git push remote localBranch

reflection prompt:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
relfection response:
auto sync on collaborative projects could break local code if not managed
command(s):
git pull remoteName remoteBranch

reflection prompt:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
reflection response:
branches, compartmentalized change paths that eventually merge or discarded
clones, copies of reposititory, history included, local or remote
fork, a clone of a repository on GitHub
command(s):
NA

reflection prompt:
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
reflection response:
git stores files, histories, and last known state of the remote
having local copy of last known states helps you compare changes
of others with yours, while working offline
command(s):
git fetch (updates last known state of the remote)
git fetch + git merge = git pull
