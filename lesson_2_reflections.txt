reflection prompt:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
reflection response:
turns a directory into a git repository
adds .git hidden folder
command(s):
ls -a
git init
git status

reflection prompt:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
reflection response:
working directory contains all files, repository tracks history of files, while
staging groups files into logical packages of commit.
enables flexibility in creating commits, don't have to include all files.
command(s):
git reset fileName (removes file from stage, still in working directory though)

reflection prompt:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
reflection response:
If multiple files changed, can be grouped in stage to be committed as a set.
Can commit single files at a time.
command(s):
git add fileName (adds file to stage)
git commit (commits all changes in stage to repo)
git commit -m "commit message" (inline commit message)
git diff (no argumenst, compares working directory with staging area)
git diff --staged (compares stage with repo)
